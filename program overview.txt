MAIN PROGRAM

Keep an integer variable 'stage'

stage = 0
	Leave start box (no line)
Junction detected -> stage 1

stage = 1
	Follow line (one junction)
Block detected -> stage 2

stage = 2
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 3

stage = 3
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION
Once complete -> stage 4

stage = 4
	Follow line (two junctions)
Block detected -> stage 5

stage = 5
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 6

stage = 6
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION
Once complete -> stage 7

stage = 7
	Follow line (three junctions)
Third junction detected -> stage 8

stage = 8
	Search for final block somehow????
Block detected -> stage 9

stage = 9
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 10

stage = 10
	Return to entrance of box
Junction detected -> stage 11

stage = 11
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION (but final turning is opposite)
Once complete -> stage 12
	
stage = 12
	Follow line
Junction detected -> stage 13

stage = 13
	Move forward (no line)
After x seconds or junction met -> DONE




-------------- 	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION --------------

stage = 0
	Rotate with block
Line detected again -> stage 2

stage = 1
	Follow line
Correct junction detected -> stage 3

stage = 2
	Turn left/right depending on block type
Turning completed -> stage 4

stage = 3
	Drive straight into centre of box
After x seconds -> stage 5

stage = 4
	Let go of block & exit box
Once done -> stage 6

stage = 5
	Turn left/right based on previous turning direction
Once done -> DONE
