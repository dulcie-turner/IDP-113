MAIN PROGRAM

Keep an integer variable 'stage'

stage = 0
	Leave start box (no line)
Junction detected -> stage 1

stage = 1
	Follow line (one junction)
Block detected -> stage 2

stage = 2
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 3

stage = 3
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION
Once complete -> stage 4

stage = 4
	Follow line (two junctions)
Block detected -> stage 5

stage = 5
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 6

stage = 6
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION
Once complete -> stage 7

stage = 7
	Follow line (three junctions)
Third junction detected -> stage 8

stage = 8
	Search for final block somehow????
Block detected -> stage 9

stage = 9
	Pick up and identify block
Block identified -> stage 10

stage = 10
	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION (but final turning is opposite)
Once complete -> stage 11
	
stage = 11
	Follow line
Junction detected -> stage 12

stage = 12
	Move forward (no line)
After x seconds or junction met -> DONE




-------------- 	RETURN BLOCK FUNCTION --------------

stage = 1
	Rotate with block
Line detected again -> stage 2

stage = 2
	Follow line
Junction detected -> stage 3

stage = 3
	Turn left/right depending on block type
Line detected again -> stage 4

stage = 4
	Drive straight
After x seconds (or line detected) -> stage 5

stage = 5
	Let go of block
Once done -> stage 6

stage = 6
	Turn 180 degrees and drive straight until junction at edge of box
Junction detected -> stage 7

stage = 7
	Follow line until junction
Junction detected -> stage 8

stage = 8
	Turn left/right based on previous turning direction
Line detected again -> DONE
